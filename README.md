Start kits for [@n3e/styled](https://www.styled.guide/).

* For [React](https://react.dev/), navigate to the `/react` folder.
* For [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), navigate to the `/solid` folder.

Each folder has its own `package.json` file with just one script `start` which will start a [vite](https://vite.dev/) server.
